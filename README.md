# MakefileExamples
A collection of Makefile examples for use in networks research

Current examples:

* `EX1_incorrect_patterns`: this shows a working, but bad practice Makefile. Use this as an example of how not to write a Makefile.
* `EX2_correct_patterns`: this shows a better version of EX1 which uses pattern rules to break up data processing into different stages and tracks the presence of generated files at each stage.
* `EX3_csp_template`: this is an example written by Colin, showing additional Makefile config options and in-depth explanations for how these options work.
